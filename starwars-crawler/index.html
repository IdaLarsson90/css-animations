            <h1>A new hope</h1>
            <p class="text">It is a period of civil war.
            Rebel spaceships, striking
            from a hidden base, have won
            their first victory against
            the evil Galactic Empire.
            <br><br>
            During the battle, Rebel
            spies managed to steal secret
            plans to the Empire's
            ultimate weapon, the DEATH
            STAR, an armored space
            station with enough power to
            destroy an entire planet.
            <br><br>
            Pursued by the Empire's
            sinister agents, Princess
            Leia races home aboard her
            starship, custodian of the
            stolen plans that can save
            her people and restore
            freedom to the galaxy....</p>
